This is all of the contents of my submission for the 2025 BPhO Computational Physics Challenge, begun in April and due in August. The British Physics Olympiad (BPhO) Computational Challenge is a competition designed to test students' problem-solving abilities using computational methods.

My submission is so far only in python, with some HTML elements as I haven't programmed in a while.
