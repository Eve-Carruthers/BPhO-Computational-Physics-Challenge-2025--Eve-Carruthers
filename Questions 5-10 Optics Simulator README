Optics Simulator

An interactive Python-based optics simulator for visualising image formation by ideal thin lenses, concave and convex spherical mirrors, and a real-time anamorphic projection mapped onto a cylindrical surface.

Features

Import any image as the object.

Visualise:

Real and virtual images in a thin lens system

Image formation by concave and convex mirrors

Anamorphic transformation of the image onto a unit circle sector

Interactive dragging of both the object and the lens/mirror

Switch modes with a radio button interface

Reset button for restoring default layout

Requirements

Python 3.7+

numpy

matplotlib

Pillow

Install with:

pip install numpy matplotlib pillow

Usage

Replace 'your_image_file.jpg' in the last line of the script with your own image path.

Run the script:

python optics_simulator.py

Scientific Background

Thin Lens Formula



: focal length

: object distance

: image distance

Mirror Equation (Concave & Convex)

Same as lens, but for convex,  is negative.

Magnification



Anamorphic Mapping

Maps image from a unit circle to a radial fan-shaped sector such that when viewed through a cylindrical mirror, the original shape appears restored in 3D.
